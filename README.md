# SuGoKu
A breadth-first algorithm-driven solution to intermediate Sudoku puzzles 

The puzzles are hard-coded variables. The program is a single Go file. 

The algorithm is indistinguishable from trying to write an algorithm for how I play Sudoku.

It can't solve every puzzle, because I can't solve the hard puzzles myself, it's a waste of time and I always give up. That's what happened to this code. Once you're convinced of the speed of this methodology over a depth-first linked list system, well, you don't really have to finish it with some more deterministic and simpler method like that, and the more complex the algorithm got for the solve, the more my head hurt..

But it's stupid fast. It solves the intermediate puzzles in milliseconds, my depth-first Java implementation for AI took hundreds of milliseconds for the same puzzles.
